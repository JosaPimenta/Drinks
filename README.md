This is a project made for the Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu.
In this project, we were expected to build a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, that integrates a chosen public API.
The website should interact with the chosen API, retrieve data, and present it in a user-friendly manner.

Objectives
Develop an understanding of how to integrate public APIs into web projects.
Gain practical experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.
Enhance understanding of client-server communication using Axios.
Demonstrate ability to manipulate, present, and work with data retrieved from APIs.
